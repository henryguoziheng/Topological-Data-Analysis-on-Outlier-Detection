# Topological-Data-Analysis-on-Outlier-Detection
Work from Fall 2022 to Summer 2023 on Topological data analysis (TDA) by Ziheng Guo

Including using TDA to detect cold front in Texas in Feburary 2021.

Including combining TDA with data depth methods to do wild fire detection. This work is a collaboration with NASA JPL and UT Dallas.

Including using Zigzag persistent homology with Alpha shape to do outlier detection.

Also include the combination of TDA and machine learning in doing simulation test and sovling real world problems.
